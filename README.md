# IMG2PDF
Bahareh Doroudiani

IMG2PDF is a script to stitch and convert image files into PDF.
This is a personal project to learn and practice version control.
There are converters already online, 
however I want to make my own converter because I don't want to upload sensitive images to online converters.

## Requirements
Install Pillow library for Python.
```bash
pip install Pillow
```
Yay!

(Please see https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/ if still confused...)

## Usage
(add images of how files should be organized)

## Acknowledgements
Thanks Google.
